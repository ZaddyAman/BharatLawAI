BharatLawAI is an AI-powered legal assistant that helps users query Indian legal acts (like IPC, CrPC, CPC, etc.) using natural language. It leverages RAG with a vector database + local LLM to provide accurate, explainable answers grounded in law.

## üß† Problem Statement

Legal information in India is vast, fragmented, and hard to access without expertise. This project solves that by:

- Making laws searchable via natural language questions
- Supporting fast and accurate legal lookups via RAG
- Allowing feedback, monitoring, and fine-tuning over time
